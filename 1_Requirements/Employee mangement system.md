`                      `1 .Insert a new record

`                      `2. Display the record

`                      `3. Search record

`                      `4 .Delete record

`                      `5. Update record

`                      `6. Sort record

`                      `7. Exit

`      `Research:

This software is efficient in maintaining the employee details. and can perform the operations.

This software helps the user to display the database of the employee  without using any paper file. 

Cost, Features and Timeline:

Cost:

- There is no fixed cost of building an application as it relies upon various variables including application highlights, functionalities.

Features:

- It saves the time of the user.
- Be easy to understand by user and operator.
- This software saves the time.
- Be easy to modify.
